# MaRS-Task-02
Through the completion of these exercises, I have acquired knowledge and practical skills in Linux and Bash scripting. These exercises have provided me with a solid foundation and enhanced my proficiency in various aspects of Linux command-line operations.

Firstly, I have developed a strong understanding of file and directory management. I can effectively navigate through directories, locate specific file types, and perform tasks such as copying and renaming files. This proficiency enables me to organize and manipulate files efficiently in a Linux environment.

Furthermore, I have gained insights into manipulating file names by appending the current date and time. This technique has proven useful for tasks that require tracking file versions or timestamps, providing me with a convenient way to manage and organize files effectively.

In addition, I have explored different approaches for generating random passwords. These methods have equipped me with the ability to create secure passwords of varying lengths, enhancing the overall security of systems and accounts.

Another area of growth has been in working with matrices. I have learnt reading matrices from files, processing the data, and display them in a standard 2D format.

By solving the 4th question, I have tried to deepen my knowledge of array manipulation and visual representation.

In summary, these exercises have provided me with hands-on experience in Linux and Bash scripting. I have developed essential skills in file management, data manipulation, and scripting techniques, allowing me to efficiently solve problems in a Linux.
